Demonstration of nix as a build system with dynamic dependencies.

This implements the example from 2.3 in Build systems a la Carte paper.

- example/default.nix is the implementation of the rules.
- demo.sh is example invocation intended to show that minimality and dynamism are followed.
- demo.sh.expected-output is its expected output: one can see that modifications
to LICENSE file don't cause a rebuild until after LICENSE line is added to docs.txt.
